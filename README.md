# Energy Consumption Trend Analysis with Power BI

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze energy consumption trends over time, identify patterns, and provide actionable insights using Power BI. The goal is to enable stakeholders to make informed decisions for optimizing energy usage and planning sustainable energy solutions.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze historical energy consumption data to identify trends and patterns.
- Provide insights into energy sources, geographical regions, and efficiency metrics.
- Help stakeholders improve energy planning and reduce costs.

## Data Requirements
The project is based on historical energy consumption data, which includes:

- Time periods – Hourly, daily, and monthly.
- Energy sources – Solar, wind, fossil fuels, etc.
- Geographical regions – Location-based data.
- Cost and efficiency metrics – If available.
- Supported formats: Excel, CSV, SQL databases

## Tools and Technologies
- Power BI – For importing, transforming, and visualizing data.
- Power Query – For data pre-processing and cleaning.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For creating measures and calculated fields.


## System Requirements
**1. **Hardware Requirements****
- Processor: Intel i5 or higher
- RAM: Minimum 8 GB (16 GB recommended)
- Storage: At least 10 GB free
  
**2. Software Requirements**
- Power BI Desktop – Latest version
- Operating System: Windows 10 or higher
- Microsoft Office – For Excel integration

## Data Modeling Approach
To ensure accurate insights, data modeling was a key step in the project:

1. Identified Primary and Foreign Keys – Defined clear relationships between datasets.
2. Established Relationships – One-to-many relationships between tables.
3. DAX Calculations – Created key metrics like total energy consumption and average hourly consumption using DAX.

## Insights and Outcomes
- Identified peak and off-peak energy consumption trends.
- Analyzed the contribution of renewable vs non-renewable sources.
- Provided actionable recommendations for improving energy efficiency and reducing costs.

## How to Run the Project
1. Download the project files.
2. Open the Power BI file (.pbix) in Power BI Desktop.
3. Load the data from the provided Excel/CSV/SQL sources.
4. Review and explore the visualizations and insights.
